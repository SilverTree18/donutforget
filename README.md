The game was built in React, using React generation NPM/Yarn tool create-react-app. The game's organized into three parts: theapplication's UI components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Project Requirements:
* Create a new React application using Create React App.
* The application should render images that listen for click events.
* The applications should keep track of the playerâ€™s score as they are playing. If a player clicks on the same image more than once, they lose and the game resets.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle in random order.
*The game automatically restarts after an incorrect guess.

Technologies Used:
*React
